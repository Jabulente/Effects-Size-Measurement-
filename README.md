# Effect Size Calculation and Measurement in Python

Overview

This repository provides a Python-based implementation for automated effect size calculations across multiple variables in a dataset. It is designed to handle pandas DataFrames, allowing users to compute effect sizes for all relevant variables at once, making it ideal for large-scale statistical analysis.

The project supports the following effect size metrics:

Pearson’s r – Measures correlation between continuous variables.

Cohen’s d – Quantifies the standardized mean difference between two groups.

Eta Squared (η²) – Determines variance explained in ANOVA.

Partial Eta Squared (η²p) – Estimates effect size while controlling for other variables.


This tool is useful for hypothesis testing, experimental research, and automated statistical reporting.

Features

✔️ Batch processing: Automatically computes effect sizes for all numerical and categorical variables in a DataFrame.
✔️ Seamless DataFrame integration: Handles multiple variables efficiently for automation.
✔️ Statistical interpretation: Provides insights into the magnitude and significance of effects.
✔️ Customizable analysis: Works with different statistical models (ANOVA, correlation, t-tests).
✔️ Optimized for research and machine learning preprocessing.
